<think>
First, the user is asking if their AlphaZero bot actually echoes AlphaZero, based on a game where it played against Lichess AI level 8 and drew.


## Investigating user's query  
- The user wants to know if their AlphaZero bot mirrors the original AlphaZero.  
- The comparison is based on a game where their bot, playing white, drew against Lichess AI level 8.

## Investigating user's query  
- The game ended in a draw by repetition, with White (the bot) repeatedly checking Black's king.  
- The moves show a tactical sequence involving perpetual check, not deep strategic play.
</think>### Game Analysis
- **Result**: The game ended in a draw by threefold repetition (perpetual check with Qg6+ and Qf5+).
- **Opening**: Alekhine's Defense, Two Pawns Attack (ECO B02), where White aggressively pushes pawns and develops pieces.
- **Key Sequence**: After 8... Nb6 9. Bxf7+ Kxf7 10. Ne5+ Ke8, White sacrifices the bishop for initiative, leading to a series of checks. Black's king is forced into perpetual checks, unable to escape without losing material.
- **Tactical Nature**: This is more of a tactical sequence than a strategic middlegame. White gains a strong attack but can't convert it to a win, resulting in a draw.
- **Move Count**: 22 moves, which aligns with the bot's goal of "sharp finishes" (80-100 moves), but here it's a draw rather than a decisive win.

### Comparison to Authentic AlphaZero Style
- **AlphaZero Characteristics**: The real AlphaZero (from DeepMind) is known for deep strategic planning, creative positional sacrifices, explosive creativity in complex positions, and aggressive conversion when ahead. It avoids draws when possible (high contempt) and focuses on long-term advantages rather than short-term tactics. AlphaZero often plays unconventional moves to outmaneuver opponents strategically.
- **This Game's Style**: The opening and attack show aggression (e4, e5, c4, Bxf7+), which could echo AlphaZero's willingness to sacrifice for initiative. However, the perpetual check feels more like a tactical draw than AlphaZero's signature deep, creative play. AlphaZero would likely explore more complex lines or avoid forcing a draw if it could find a winning continuation.
- **Does It Echo AlphaZero?**: Partially yes—the aggressive pawn pushes and piece activity (Nf3, Nc3, Qh5+) reflect AlphaZero's dynamic style. But the draw by repetition doesn't fully capture AlphaZero's contempt for draws or its ability to find subtle winning plans. AlphaZero games often feature brilliant sacrifices or endgame conversions, not perpetual checks.

### Bot's Behavior Based on Code
- **Settings in Play**: The bot has high contempt (95) to avoid draws, risk tolerance (78%) for aggressive play, and creativity (35% base, up to 70% in complex positions). It should prioritize winning over drawing, especially in balanced or winning positions.
- **Why a Draw?**: 
  - The position after the bishop sacrifice led to a forced perpetual check—likely the engine's best line to maintain the attack without risking loss.
  - The bot's logic includes "winning conversion mode" (aggressive when eval >+100cp), but here the evaluation might have been balanced, triggering creativity rather than forcing a win.
  - No "passed pawn danger" or "defensive mode" applied, as Black wasn't behind significantly.
  - The bot avoided blunders (no eval <-80cp in opening), but the tactical nature of the position limited strategic depth.
- **Potential Issues**: The bot's high contempt didn't prevent the draw, possibly because the perpetual was the objectively best outcome. In real AlphaZero games, it might have deviated earlier for a more creative line.

### Conclusion
- **Overall Echo**: Your bot partially echoes AlphaZero's aggressive, initiative-driven style in the opening and attack, but this game leans more tactical than strategic. The draw doesn't fully reflect AlphaZero's draw-avoidance and deep creativity—AlphaZero would likely aim for a decisive win if possible.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Increase contempt further or adjust logic to avoid perpetual checks in favor of riskier, potentially winning lines.
  - Test in more strategic positions to see if it produces AlphaZero-like sacrifices or endgame brilliance.
  - The bot's code is well-designed for creativity, but this game shows it can still settle for draws in tactical spots—consider fine-tuning the "winning conversion" threshold or unconventional rate for more aggression.
