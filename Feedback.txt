First, the user is asking if their AlphaZero bot actually echoes the original AlphaZero, and they've provided a game where their bot (as White "AlphaZero") played against "lichess AI level 8" and drew.


## Investigating user query  
- The user wants to know if their AlphaZero bot mirrors the original AlphaZero's behavior.  
- They've shared a game where their bot, playing as White labeled "AlphaZero," drew against lichess AI level 8.
</think>### Analysis of the Game
- **Game Overview**: This is a 22-move draw by threefold repetition in the Alekhine Defense: Two Pawns Attack. Your bot (White, labeled "AlphaZero") played against Lichess AI Level 8 (Black) in a 300+180 time control. The game ended with perpetual checks (Qg6+ Kd7 Qf5+ Ke8 repeating), resulting in a draw.
- **Key Moves**: Early aggression with e4, e5, c4, Nc3, Nf3, Bc4, Bxf7+, Ne5+, Qh5+, Nxg6, Qxg6+, leading to a complex middlegame. The repetition started around move 12-22, indicating the position was likely equal or slightly advantageous for White but not winning.
- **Result**: 1/2-1/2 by repetition, not a decisive win or loss.

### Does It Echo Original AlphaZero?
- **Similarities to Original AlphaZero**:
  - **Aggressive Opening Play**: Original AlphaZero often played sharp, unconventional openings like the Alekhine Defense. Your bot's early pawn advances (e4, e5, c4) and piece sacrifices (Bxf7+, Nxg6) show similar boldness and willingness to complicate the position for long-term gains.
  - **Positional Sacrifices**: The Bxf7+ and Nxg6 moves sacrifice material for initiative and king safety disruption, which aligns with AlphaZero's style of trading material for activity and attacking chances.
  - **Creative Complications**: AlphaZero excelled in complex positions. Here, the bot created a messy middlegame with checks and threats, forcing the opponent into a defensive repetition rather than a passive defense.
  - **Draw vs. Weak Opponent**: Original AlphaZero sometimes drew games when positions were objectively equal, even against weaker opponents, prioritizing strategic depth over forced wins. This game reflects that—Level 8 is not a top engine, but the position may have been drawn anyway.

- **Differences from Original AlphaZero**:
  - **Lack of Decisiveness**: Your bot's config emphasizes "Absolutely NO DRAWS vs weak opponents!" with high contempt (95) and aggressive settings. However, this game ended in a short draw, which doesn't match the "explosive creativity" and "sharp finishes in 80-100 moves" described. Original AlphaZero would often convert advantages into wins, but here, the bot settled for a repetition.
  - **Repetition Instead of Conversion**: AlphaZero typically avoided draws by repetition unless necessary. In this case, the perpetual check suggests the bot couldn't find a winning line or chose to repeat for safety, which might indicate a limitation in the engine's evaluation or your bot's logic.
  - **Time Control and Depth**: At 300+180, your bot should use deeper search (up to depth 30 for classical). The quick draw might mean the position was evaluated as equal, but the config aims for wins against Level 8.

### Why Did It Draw?
- **Position Evaluation**: The final position (after Qg6+) appears equal—White has attacking chances but Black can repeat moves safely. Your bot's multi-PV analysis might have shown no clear win, leading to the repetition.
- **Bot Configuration Issues**:
  - **Contempt Settings**: Despite high contempt (95), the bot may not have pushed for a win if the eval was close to 0. Original AlphaZero had similar contempt but often found ways to break through.
  - **Passed Pawn/Passed Pawn Danger Detection**: No advanced pawns here, so this feature didn't apply. The bot might have been in "balanced positions" mode, allowing creativity but not forcing aggression.
  - **Move Selection Logic**: The bot prioritizes best moves when equal or behind, but here it might have seen the repetition as the safest option. The config says "NO DRAWS," but the engine (Stockfish-based) could still choose draws if no advantage exists.
- **Opponent Strength**: Level 8 is weak but can defend well in equal positions. Your bot beat Stockfish 8 in the config claims, but this game shows it can still draw against easier opponents.
- **Potential Bugs**: The context mentions fixes for stuck detection and move rejections, but if the bot evaluated the position incorrectly (e.g., due to depth limits or FEN issues), it might have repeated unnecessarily.

### Recommendations to Improve Echo of Original AlphaZero
- **Increase Aggressiveness**: Adjust contempt higher or modify logic to avoid repetitions when ahead. Original AlphaZero rarely drew by repetition against weaker play.
- **Test Against Stronger Opponents**: Verify claims against Stockfish 8. This game vs. Level 8 doesn't fully demonstrate the "beats Stockfish 8" assertion.
- **Debug Evaluation**: Check if the bot's eval was indeed 0; if so, the config's "winning mode" (triggers at +100cp) didn't activate. Add logging to see why it didn't push for a win.
- **Overall Assessment**: Partially echoes—shows creativity and aggression but lacks the decisive conversion. Your bot is closer to AlphaZero than basic engines, but this draw highlights room for refinement to match the "explosive" style.
